# sodoken changelog

## 0.0.10

- Switch from `libsodium-sys-stable` to `libsodium-sys`. The former is downloading pre-built binaries on Windows which is proving flaky and the latter is deprecated so we shouldn't need to worry about the version of libsodium it installs moving any more.

## 0.0.1

- Initial release
